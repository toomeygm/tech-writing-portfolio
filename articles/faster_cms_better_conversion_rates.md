## Making every second count: How a faster CMS leads to better conversion rates
#### Website speed directly affects conversion rates. A faster-rendering CMS increases audience retention, which boosts conversion. 

To compete in today’s digital landscape, website speed is everything. Slow loads build a barrier to conversion, since a user is more likely to abandon the page and visit a competitor site.
Thankfully, the right content management system (CMS) helps you build an engaging, smooth user experience that improves conversion rates for your business.

#### What is a conversion rate?

Conversion rate refers to the percentage of users who have completed a desired action on a website. A web page can have a variety of purposes, so desired actions don’t always mean purchasing a product — they also could include filling out a form, signing up for a newsletter, or clicking on a link.

#### How does CMS performance affect conversion rates?

Optimizing conversion rates is vital for any online marketing strategy. Adopting a user-centric approach helps marketers understand what engages, drives, and persuades website visitors. 

Part of this approach is removing all barriers to the best possible user experience — and one barrier is slow page speed.
 
Faster page loads mean lower bounce rates, since even a one-second delay can significantly decrease conversions. To speed up loading, you need a fast-rendering CMS that delivers quick responses and handles heavy site traffic. This will help you retain your audience and maximize your conversion rate.
