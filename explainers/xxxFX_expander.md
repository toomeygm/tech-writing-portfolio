# What is xxxFX Expander?

xxxFX Expander is a dynamic effect that changes the signal gain depending on the input level.

## How does xxxFX Expander affect an audio recording?

If the level falls below a certain value (the threshold), the signal is attenuated by a factor (ratio) for every dB it drops below the threshold. 
This preserves the loud parts of the audio signal and attenuates the quiet parts. You can use the effect to emphasize the attack of percussion instruments over their decay phases and room ambience in a recording.

## Other uses for xxxFX Expander
* xxxFX Expander is also ideal for gradually fading out noise to produce a more natural sound than a pure noise gate, which simply mutes the signal below the threshold completely. 
It also stretches the dynamic range of an audio signal. In this way, it works as a counterpart to the compressor, which reduces dynamic range. This means that you can also use xxxFX Expander to compensate for the effects of excessive compression of a signal.

* A secondary stereo input channel pair can be used to control the effect with sidechaining. The expander is then controlled by another audio signal. This allows the volume of the signal to be controlled by the volume of another signal. 
For example, you can link the drums and bass more rhythmically by having the drums on one track increase the volume of the bass on another track.
